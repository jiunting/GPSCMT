Generating GFs is SLOW! so you may want to generate all GFs that will be used for the later purpose.
For example, earthquakes only occurres in some area, and you are always using those same stations for inversion.......
In this sense, pre-generate those can save you a lot of time! (Important for EEW.)
But now in this example, I'll walk you from generate the GFs that you're focusing on and make the CMT inversion 

1.First generate Green's functions(GFs) for your area
  1.1 source location file (lon,lat,dep): TW_dense.grid
  1.2 station file (stalon,stalat,staname): TPN_All_filt.sta
